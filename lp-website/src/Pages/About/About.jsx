              <p>My favorite part of LaunchPad was how supportive and conducive the environment was for me to develop my first meaningful project. My mentor and I were able to create a good working relationship that enabled me to enhance and develop my technical and creative skills. Furthermore, during my time as a mentor last year, I was able to provide the knowledge and expertise that I had gained over the course of my time here at Purdue to my mentee and help him navigate and transition to life at college.</p>

              <p>LaunchPad has been an exceptional organization that has had a profound impact on me since my freshman year. The absolute best part of LaunchPad, for me, has been the opportunity to immerse myself in various projects. As a mentor, I relished in the chance to contemplate the high-level design decisions that went into my mentees' projects. And as a mentee myself, I experienced the entire design process, from its inception to its completion, while being guided by a talented mentor. In both roles, I derived immense satisfaction from working on diverse projects that spanned across various realms of computer science.</p>

              <h5 className="participation"><i>Mentee '21, Mentor '22, '23</i></h5>
              <p>LaunchPad provided me with a valuable experience as a mentee as well as a mentor. As a mentee, I learned new and valuable technical skills, while as a mentor, I had the privilege of sharing my knowledge and experience. I also got the opportunity to network with like-minded people in CS. I highly recommend the LaunchPad program to anyone looking to gain new skills and make meaningful connections!</p>
